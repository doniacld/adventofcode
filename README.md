# adventofcode

This is my take on the [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/) in Go.

You will find in this repository the resolution of problems day by day.
In each one them, you can find the programming puzzles problem in the README. 

My goal is to maintain my Go level, practice algorithms skills and obvisouly learn new stuffs!
My friends [ablqk](https://github.com/ablqk) and [floppyzedolfin](https://github.com/floppyzedolfin/) are the ones  
that made me dive into this challenge. Also, they will be my reviewers.  

## Quickstart

The current used version of Go is `1.14` but my intention is to move to Go `1.16`.

You can play this repository by using the Makefile (or not but not recommended!).  
Build the repository:

    make build

Run the program for day 1 for example:

    make run 1 2021

Launch the tests:

    make test

Launch the tests with the cover: 

    make test_cover
